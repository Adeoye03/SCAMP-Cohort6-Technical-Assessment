# Vuejs Technical Assessment  
- Create a repository on Github called ``SCAMP-C6 Assesment``

- Using VueJs, build out this ![ e-commerce product page](https://github.com/WajesmartDevTeam/SCAMP-Cohort6-Technical-assessment/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the [frontend](/frontend) folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.


## Aesthetic Requirements
The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you’ll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin.
  
## Functional requirements 
- User should be able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device’s screen size
- User should be able to see hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- User should be able to open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- User should be able to switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
